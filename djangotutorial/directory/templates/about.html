               <strong>Welcome to the UNT Campus Map Directory!</strong>
               <br><br>
               Have you ever wished that there was one detailed place to explore all the locations at the University
               of North Texas? Maybe you're having trouble finding where that one classroom is, or you're hungry and want to see what's in the area.
               That's why we created this directoryâ€”to help you explore the UNT campus with ease.
               <br><br>
               Whether you're new to UNT or just looking for a faster way to navigate your day, you're in the right place.
               <br><br>

               <strong>About the Creators</strong>
               <br><br>
               We built the UNT Campus Map Directory with the UNT community in mind; This could be for students, staff, and anybody else who calls UNT home.
               Being students overselves, we have many first-hand experiences that could have been solved, avoided,
                or simplified if we had access to an all-in-one UNT map.
                <br><br>
                This idea became the foundation for our project. Our goal is to make it easy for members of the UNT community to view and locate buildings, rooms,
                food options, recreational areas, and more.
