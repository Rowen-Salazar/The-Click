# UNT Campus Directory
### GitHub for the UNT Campus Directory project

The goal of this project is to create a web application that provides students, faculty, and visitors of the UNT campuses access to campus building locations, specific room locations, and various other campus location categories. This web application will also allow users to locate directions to campus buildings using Google Maps.
